We are a marketing agency specialized in advertising software products, taking care of cross-channel advertising activities for 5 customers:

- Alpha Innovations
- TechCorp
- DataTech
- Solutions Innovate Industries
- NexGen Systems

Our goal is to optimise their ad spends and boost the user engagement with their ads by finding the right audiences in the right places at the right time.

We analyzed the overall campaign ad spend and performance data from 2021 to answer following questions:

- How was the yearly revenue for our agency - how did our clients spend with us across the year?
- What was our unit pricing (CPM) throughout the year and was it well assessed?
- How was the quality of the traffic - was there any variation in performance, and if so, why?
- Optimization insights: what is the best performing channel?
- Optimization insights: When is it the best time of the year to advertise based on different locations?
- Optimization insights: What is the best performing channel for which campaign duration?

These insights help us in two ways:

- We provide our stakeholders with a clear overview of our achievements
- We identify strengths and weaknesses in our targeting and media buying strategy to optimize the campaigns of our current clients and develop benchmarks for potential clients
